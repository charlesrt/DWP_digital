        Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) impacts the lives of virtually everyone in the UK each day.
      </p>

      <p>
        We help people to find employment, deliver their welfare support and manage state-run pensions. This gives us the unique opportunity to make strategic changes to how we deliver services across the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        We employ over 84,000 staff across the UK. We spent £175 billion across these services in tax year 2014 to 2015. As part of this organisation, the Commercial Directorate plays a critical role in shaping how services are delivered across a variety of contractual arrangements. We have an annual procurement spend of roughly £3 billion on third-party suppliers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Commercial Directorate recently launched a category management and operating model to support DWP's ongoing Commercial Improvement programme. This will develop expertise and deliver savings and efficiencies to each of DWP’s key functions:

      </ul>


      <p>
        Several long-established contracts supporting DWP are expiring soon which allows us to make strategic changes to how we deliver services across the country. We aim to increase efficiency and reduce costs by creating a new approach to procurement, challenging agreements with existing suppliers and creating new supplier relationships.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our people are key to changing DWP for the better. It’s an exciting time to join the Commercial Directorate.
