        Help transform DWP
      </h2>

      <p>DWP needs experts in digital design, technology and code to help transform the public services millions of people rely on.</p>

      <p>We’re changing the way we work to become a leading example of agile delivery. We’re building a team of digital specialists to make simpler, clearer, faster services, that put the people who use them first.</p>

      <p>It’s a huge challenge. Our services touch the lives of almost everyone in the UK at some point. Our IT systems manage 7.35m benefit claims each year, paying £165 billion in benefits and pensions.</p>

      <p class="lede quoted">Changing the UK welfare system.</p>

      <p>We're simplifying the benefits systems through Universal Credit. We’re increasing opportunities for disabled people through Personal Independence Payments. And we’re making sure people can enjoy retirement by supporting pension savings and changing how the State Pension Works.</p>

      <p>We’re now looking for digital experts who are motivated by the challenge of working on these large-scale user-centred services running on massive platforms.</p>

      <p>It’s an exciting time to join us.</p>



			<h2 class="heading-large">Meet our people</h2>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Arun Zachariah, delivery manager</h3>

      <img class="img-profile" src="/public/images/profile-zach.png" />
      <p>
        In the commercial world you deliver an application and then you leave. Here your actions have a direct impact on a range of people’s lives.</p>

      <p>My job is to make sure that the team functions effectively, I help guide them to doing the right things, at the right time, in the right way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing the services that DWP is building making a real difference to people makes me feel my job is worthwhile.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Sophie Lambert, user researcher</h3>

      <img class="img-profile" src="/public/images/profile-sophie.png" />

      <p>
        Good user research is the foundation of good service design. As a user researcher I’m listening to our users to understand their lives, their desires, motivations, and needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        At DWP our user groups are diverse and have complex, often difficult lives. We use a range of research techniques to find out what our users are trying to do when they use our service, to understand why it’s not working for them now, and to think about how we can make their experience better.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seeing users try out a service that you’ve helped to shape is really exciting, and when you can see that you’ve made a positive impact on their life it’s incredibly rewarding.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Melanie Cannon, content designer</h3>

      <img class="img-profile" src="/public/images/profile-mel.png" />

      <p>
        Content is what services are made of, it determines what people think of us. My job is to remove the complexity and frustrations from our services.</p>
      <p>It's about getting close to our users and empathising with the problems they have interacting with government. And making sure people using our services only have to do the things that are absolutely necessary to get what they need simply and quickly.
      </p>
        <p>It's incredibly satisfying to see how we're making the lives of vulnerable people that bit easier.
