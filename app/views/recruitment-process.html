        1. How to apply
      </h3>

      <p>
        Just complete a short application form on our Civil Service Jobs page.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may also be required to submit a CV and covering letter. You’ll be able to monitor the progress of your application through the Civil Service Jobs page.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-large">
        2. After you apply
      </h3>

      <p>
        We’ll aim to update you on progress within 2 weeks of the closing date. In that time, we’ll be sifting the applications. This is when we look at your technical skills to make sure they are at the right level for the role you’ve applied for.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’ve made the shortlist, we’ll send you an email to invite you for an interview. If it's appropriate for the role, we'll also arrange some technical testing.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-large">
        3. At the interview
      </h3>

      <p>
        We expect you to demonstrate your technical skills. Depending on the role, we might ask you to present your recent work or take online tests.
      </p>

      <p>
        We want to see your non-technical skills too, such as leading and communicating, collaborating and partnering, and delivering at pace. You can find the competencies which are required for your role in the job description.
      </p>

      <p>
        You'll need to bring some identification documents on the day of the interview.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-large">
        4. After the interview
      </h3>

      <p>
        We’ll make successful candidates a conditional offer. We might negotiate with you on the details.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’ll need to complete security and pre-employment checks before we can make you a formal offer and agree a start date.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re not successful, we’ll let you know. Sign in to Civil Service Jobs to see feedback from the interview. This feedback might help you to apply for other roles with us in the future. If you like, we can also keep your details on file and notify you of future opportunities. Following all recruitment exercises we will ask for your feedback to help identify areas to improve.
