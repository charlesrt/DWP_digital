      </p>

        After you apply
      </h2>

      <p class="lede">
        We’ll aim to update you on progress within 2 weeks of the closing date. In that time, we’ll be sifting the applications. This is when we look at your technical skills to make sure they are the right level for the role you’ve applied for.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’ve made the short list, we’ll send you an e-mail to invite you for an interview and/or arrange some technical testing if appropriate for the role.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-large">
        At the interview
      </h2>

      <p class="lede">
        We expect you to demonstrate your technical skills. Depending on the role, we might ask you to present your recent work or undertake online tests.
      </p>

      <p>
        We want to see your non-technical skills too, such as leading and communicating, collaborating and partnering, and delivering at pace.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will be required to supply some identification documents on the day of the interview.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-large">
        After the interview
      </h2>

      <p class="lede">
        We’ll make successful candidates a conditional offer. We might negotiate with you on the details.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        You’ll need to complete security and pre-employment checks before we can make you a formal offer and agree a start date.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re not successful, we’ll let you know. Log onto Civil Service Jobs to see feedback on the interview. The feedback might help you to apply for other roles with us in future. If you like, we can also keep your details on file and notify you of future opportunities. Following all recruitment exercises we will ask for your candidate feedback to help monitor our success and identify areas to improve.
