        Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) delivers public services that millions of people rely on. We transform lives by helping the most disadvantaged people to turn their lives around.
      </p>

      <p>
        People increasingly expect to access services digitally when it suits them. We are transforming the way we operate to design automated, efficient services in an agile way that puts peopleâ€™s needs first.
      </p>

      <p>
        Transforming services that DWP provides will improve how government interacts with people. The services will be easier and swifter to access, the time to develop new services will be decreased and the cost of delivery will be reduced significantly.
      </p>

      <p>
        To do this, we need user researchers and digital delivery teams to design simple, interactive and re-usable services that meet our diverse user needs.
